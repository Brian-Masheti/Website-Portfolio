# Brian Masheti Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I am Brian Masheti, a data analyst and software engineer passionate about leveraging data to drive decision-making and building innovative solutions. This website showcases my skills, projects, education, interests, and provides a way to contact me.

## Features

- **Navigation**: Easy navigation with sections for Home, About Me, Programming Languages, Education, Interests, Projects, and Contact.
- **Contact Form**: A functional contact form using Formspree to send messages directly to my email.
- **Download CV**: Active "Download CV" buttons in the Home and Footer sections, linking to my resume hosted on Google Drive.
- **Social Media Links**: Clickable links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, X, and Facebook profiles in both Home and Footer sections.
- **Styling**: Modern design with a starry night background, gradient footer, and animated navbar.
- **Back to Top**: A "Back to Top" button in the footer for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including animations, gradients, and responsive design.
- **External Libraries**:
  - [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/) for social media icons in the footer.
  - [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/) for social media icons in the home section.
  - [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) for icons in the contact section.
- **Formspree**: For handling the contact form submissions.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Project**:
   - If using Git: `git clone <repository-url>` (once hosted on GitHub).
   - Alternatively, download the project files as a ZIP and extract them.

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to view the site locally.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure an internet connection to load external CDNs:
     - Boxicons: `<link href="https://unpkg.com/boxicons@2.1.4/css/boxicons.min.css" rel="stylesheet">`
     - Devicon: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/devicon@2.15.1/devicon.min.css">`
     - Material Symbols: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20..48,100..700,0..1,-50..200" />`
   - No additional installations are required since the site uses pure HTML and CSS.

## Deployment
The website is currently hosted on [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.com/) at the following URL:
- **Live URL**: `brianmasheti.infinityfreeapp.com` (replace with your actual subdomain once set up).

### Hosting Steps
1. **InfinityFree Setup**:
   - Signed up for a free account on InfinityFree.
   - Created a subdomain (e.g., `brianmasheti.infinityfreeapp.com`).
   - Uploaded all project files to the `htdocs` folder using the InfinityFree File Manager.
2. **CV Hosting**:
   - The CV (`BrianMashetiResume.pdf`) is hosted on Google Drive with a direct download link: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1gSstBraFfMeUE0T-n1bEab-cgyhtT5vK`.

### Future Deployment Plans
- Plan to learn and migrate the site to **GitHub Pages** for a more reliable hosting solution with a custom subdomain (e.g., `brianmasheti.github.io`).
